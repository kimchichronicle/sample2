 <h1> My Objective </h1> 
 <p> For several years, I have always wanted to learn how to code. It seemed that the world somehow moved on to the world where almost anyone but me know how to code, and they all speak of it all the time. <br />I am now finally taking the first step of finding out what all that fuss is about. As I learn more about it, I will see what I want to do with my new skill.</p>

 <p> On a different note, when I build my own website, I want to post gorgeous pictures of mine looking just like this.</p>
